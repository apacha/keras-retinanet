# Music Object Detection with RetinaNet

For training Music Object Detection with RetinaNet, you can closely follow the original tutorial and steps:

- Build the cPython parts by running `python setup.py build_ext --inplace`
- Download and normalize all datasets as described in this [README](https://bitbucket.org/apacha/music-object-detection/src).
- Copy the normalized datasets from the directory `data/normalized` of that repository into this repository `data/normalized`.
